# HTML-CSS-Lap


## Introduction

We have only learned the very basics today with HTML and CSS, so what the heck we can really build, right? Wrong, we can build some cool stuff already, and we are going to do just that.

We all have to eat (at least, we should), so let's make some handy recipe page. We are going to be recreating an Apple Pie recipe.

Cloning something that already exists is the best way to get better at frontend development, so check out the deliverable below to see what we are expecting.

Some starter code is already provided, so you can jump right into it.

## Requirements

- Make sure you use `class` and `id` selectors throughout your exercise. Remember, only use type selectors if you want to modify _every_ element of that type
- Use a single external CSS stylesheet to style all pages
- Use the images provided to construct the appropriate elements on the page:
  - The background with a picture of the apple pie
  - The recipe servings / nutrients section
  - The prep section

## Instructions

You will be working in the `HTML-CSS-Lap` folder. There you will find all the files, images, and text content needed to create the page. The text is in the `index.html`, and a CSS file is created `style.css`.

## Deliverable

Expected results:
